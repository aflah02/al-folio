Hi, I'm Aflah, a junior at IIIT Delhi. I'm an undergraduate student researcher at Laboratory for Computational Social Systems (LCS2), where I work on natural language processing and computational social science. I love building stuff and I'm passionate about deep learning and neural networks. Some of my current research interests are Hate Speech Analysis, Model Probing, Memorization in LLMs and NLP for Social Good.
